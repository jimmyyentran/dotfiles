# My dotfiles
- A collaboration of [holman/dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles.git)
  and [robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git).
- There is still a lot of tweaking required but I enjoy holman's script which
  symlinks all files ending in `*.symlink` to the home folder.
- Both of these repos use the variable $ZSH pointing to the respective repo's
  folder location. I changed holman/dotfile's default variable to $ZSH to avoid
  conflicts with robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh's submodule.
